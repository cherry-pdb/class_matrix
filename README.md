Project was written on c++.
In this project I realised container class Matrix and class Iterator. 
There are all tests on each method in class.

--------------


Techniсal task:

Develop a template container class according to the variant, as well as an iterator class to it. 
Test the developed class. 
For each option, a list of public methods and explanations to them are specified – this is the minimum set of methods that need to be implemented for this option. 
If the operation cannot to be executed, an exception must be thrown.

The student can optionally implement other methods that he finds useful and applicable for this class.
The development should be guided by the principles of OOP. 
The use of containers from libraries is prohibited. 
As part of the laboratory work, it is necessary to use the following patterns: properties, iterator.

Testing should be performed using a test program (a console program is sufficient). 
It is necessary to check all public methods of the implemented class.
